            1000 meters of altitude. The sanctuary is nourished by several water bodies, amongst which rivers Kandati,

            Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary is full of nature's bounty; apart from spotting animals, here one can see
            many other things that can make the holiday a special one. Just a few stops downhill trek from the untamed
            wilderness lies the Konkan coast. Multiple layers of mauve hills and lake at a distance looks beautiful,
            especially when the sun starts showing its true colors.
